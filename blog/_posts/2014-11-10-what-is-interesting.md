## Is This Interesting?

And yet, if you only go by what you find _online_ you'll still miss a lot of things even in the year 2014. A reminder is worth repeating. You should not believe everything you read online. 

Also, as of late, you should not assume everything found in quantity online is _interesting_. It is getting harder to understand where the true sentiment begins and the astroturf begins.

Worse, if we are are not all diligent then we find that we will be told what is interesting. Signal and squelch metaphors aside, there is far more traffic on the Internet now and it is growing in ways more than one.

Why allow the few to influence the even fewer that decide what impacts so many?

## This Amp Goes To 11.

Spam was once associated with Usenet. Then spam became associaed with email. 

There are cute Internet born neologisms that predict spam is a hallmark of success in any new communication type or increasingly social services. 

So, why spam new social services? 

 * A wider audience that might click something to drive paid traffic 
 * Creating a curation or cool factor service to amplify a message
 * Payola models born in the times of radio applied to the current wild west online
 * Exploring virality for the sake of virality aka *growth hacking*
 * LULZ
 * Promote an agenda _because_ _promote_ _an_ _agenda_
 * etc...

Utlimately, as these sayings go, the spam is sure to follow.

## Twitter Is Blowing Up

A tweet that gets heard around the world! The people have spoken!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>A tweet with lots of RTs is the Internet equivalent of being on the Fan Cam Jumbotron of a last place NBA team on a half off nachos night.</p>&mdash; llerhtuC yaJ (@Qthrul) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qthrul/status/530217408363917312">November 6, 2014</a></blockquote>

Or, have the people been conscripted to minimum viable policy statement?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/Uber">@Uber</a> prompts to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/astroturf?src=hash">#astroturf</a> tweet to both <a href="https://twitter.com/GovSandoval">@GovSandoval</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/NevadaAG">@NevadaAG</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vegastech?src=hash">#vegastech</a> <a href="http://t.co/Hp7wri4rAx">pic.twitter.com/Hp7wri4rAx</a></p>&mdash; llerhtuC yaJ (@Qthrul) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qthrul/status/529080990535122945">November 3, 2014</a></blockquote>

Or, are the politicians figuring out new ways to troll us all?

Talking heads and talking points will always find a new venue, forum, and vehicle to disseminate. As such, spam has a few more hurdles to clear before it goes directly into our brains.

 * Never let a service tell you what is interesting.
 * Never stop asking what is interesting.
 * Always keep an eye out for what is interesting.
