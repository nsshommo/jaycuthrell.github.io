You've perhaps seen me at events or seen my content in [other places](https://plus.google.com/110357001884194145645/posts) or on [my public blog](http://fudge.org) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/qthrul), etc... and that's been great. What I've lacked in frequency here on the old bloggity blog I hope to make up for soon... starting by purposely NOT doing a 2011 Recap/Top Stories/Year in Review.




[




So, here's the double redacted pseudo-cryptic secret spilled finally about what I'm doing now... (Hint: It's the title of this post)




I'm hoping to be around these parts a bit more now in my new (slightly more formalized) role as Evangelist for strategic sales in Global Service Providers (SP) and Systems Integrators (SI) at [VCE](http://www.vce.com/). This is my sixth or seventh title within VCE but it's always been a part of my day to day duties. I'm still as passionate as ever about helping companies realize the dream of ubiquitous workload substrates in their datacenters: Vblock Infrastructure Platforms.




[




**So... What's new?**




For 2012 (and frankly right now!) the following areas are where I'll focus for the Vblock ecosystem:






  * VCE Strategic Accounts


  * VCE Executive Briefing Center (EBC), Cisco EBC, EMC EBC, VMware EBC, and VCE Technology Alliance Partner EBC


  * VCE Customer Advisory Board


  * Speaking and representing VCE for SP/SI events with VCE Marketing


  * Champion for SP/SI specific initiatives




Put another way... I get to put on hats of many shapes and sizes working with the most amazing teams one could ask for.






  * Evangelist for strategic sales in SP/SI with VCE Strategic Accounts customer meetings


  * Representative for strategic sales along side VCE Corporate Engineering (seriously... [uber](http://thomaschatham.com/) [mega](http://blog.mr-vm.com/) [rockstars](http://vmforsp.typepad.com/) [galore](http://blog.aarondelp.com/)) at EBCs, CABs, etc.


  * Speaking and representing VCE for SP/SI at public events through VCE Marketing at trade shows, road shows, etc.


  * Embed with Cisco, EMC, VMware teams in SP/SI specific offerings such as VMDC, PMDC, HCS, UC, Puppet, NMS, SAP, Cloud Foundry, etc.


  * Collaborate with VCE Technology Alliance Partners on SP/SI specific offerings from APPTIO, ASTARO, CA TECHNOLOGIES, COLLABNET, INFOBLOX, INFORMATICA, LIQUIDWARE LABS, NIMSOFT, SAS, SCIENCELOGIC, UNIDESK, VISUAL NETWORK SYSTEMS, XANGATI, etc.


  * Create SP/SI specific social media content like this blog and other internal blogs, Twitter, YouTube, SlideRocket, Google+, Friendster, etc.

**That sounds like a lot of stuff and overuse of etc. so what do you bring to the table?**




_Do you need someone from VCE that has been around a while and gets it? _I've been with VCE for well over a year. That makes me 85 years old in VCE years. I get it. I know a bunch more like me.... WE get it.




_Do you need the goto place for something that is VCE or Vblock specific? _Ping me. I'll get it for you or find someone smarter that will. One stop shopping. Fast and easy delivery. Hmm... that sounds FAMILIAR.




**Yeah, but what we need is X, Y, Z, and... and... and...**




Whatever it is... We're going to figure this out and we're going to make it happen.




GAMEON!!!
