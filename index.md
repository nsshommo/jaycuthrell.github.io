### Discussion Leader Themes

* Any sufficiently advanced product is indistinguishable from marketing
* Listen to futurists and historians before ignoring both
* The perfect team is one to do it, one to write it down, and one to think ahead
* Balancing innovation, governance, and computational possibilities
* And more... just give me a few days to prepare
